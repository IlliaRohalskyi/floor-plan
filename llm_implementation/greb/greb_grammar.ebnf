GREB Thought Language — Grammar Overview

The Generic Role–Entity-Based (GREB) Thought Language is a controlled, declarative representation designed to encode semantic relationships between entities using explicit role associations. Instead of modeling geometry directly, GREB represents spatial and functional structure as a graph composed of entities (e.g., rooms, walls, doors) and role pairs (e.g., room & wall, wall & door, connected & access). This abstraction enables reasoning over topological relationships, access paths, and component composition without requiring metric or geometric information.

The grammar below defines a simplified Extended Backus–Naur Form (EBNF) for the GREB language, as used in this work. It specifies the lexical elements (identifiers, numbers, time expressions), the structure of role-based associations, and the permissible forms of declarations and association paths. In the context of this project, the grammar serves as the formal target language for LLM-generated outputs, ensuring syntactic validity and consistency across generated GREB programs. All GREB code produced in the experiments strictly adheres to this grammar.
